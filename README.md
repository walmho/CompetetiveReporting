# CompetetiveReporting
Uses the Jinja library to create report files on datasets

The goal of this project is for me to learn how to manipulate and read CSV files to make simple and eventually more complex correlations between different data and information.

I will then use these skills with the Jinja library to make a competitive reporting program that makes printouts of organized data
